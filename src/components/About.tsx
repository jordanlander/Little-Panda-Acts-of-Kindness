              I am a retired art teacher with years of experience working with PreK through 
              12th-grade students. I started Little Panda about three years ago after retiring, 
              wanting to begin creating my own personal art and find a purpose in sharing it 
              with others.
            </p>

              After my son got me involved with the Erie Pride Festival, I found my purpose 
              through the creation of semi-ugly dolls, recycled stuffed animals, and now my 
              closet monsters and inspirational drawings. Each doll is hand-stitched from 
              recycled sweaters and shirts, designed to have its own personality and name.

              I will take orders online and ship free of charge. I try to share a little 
              "Panda Acts of Kindness" with the world.
