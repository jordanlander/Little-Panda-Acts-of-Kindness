              I am an artist! I paint, draw, and now create fabric dolls. I have always 
              loved plush animals and dolls since childhood. My mother taught me simple 
              sewing skills, and every doll I make is hand-stitched from recycled sweaters 
              and shirts.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I design each doll to have its own personality and name â€” they are meant to 
              bring comfort, joy, and connection. My current work explores fine arts and 
              spiritual doll-making as a way to create change within myself and inspire others.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-rust-clay font-semibold italic">
              Each doll is crafted with intention, love, and a belief that handmade art 
              can touch hearts and bring people together.
